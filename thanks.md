I've had the good fortune to work with and learn from some amazing people throughout my career. To my mentors, colleagues, and everyone I’ve crossed paths with—thank you for the guidance, the feedback, and the challenges that have pushed me to grow. You’ve all had a hand in helping me get to where I am today.

A big thanks also goes to my family and friends for always having my back. Your support means the world to me, and I couldn’t have done this without you. Cheers to everyone who’s been part of the journey!
